# uwg

The Urban Weather Generator (uwg) is a Python application for modeling the [urban heat island effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island). Specifically, it morphs rural [EnergyPlus weather (.epw) files](http://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/) to reflect average conditions within the urban canyon using a range of properties including:

* Building geometry (including building height, ground coverage, window:wall area, and facade:site area)
* Building use (including program type, HVAC systems, and occupancy/equipment scheduling)
* Cooling system heat rejection to the outdoors (for Summer)
* Indoor heat leakage to the outdoors (for Winter)
* Urban materials (including the thermal mass, albedo and emissivity of roads, walls, and roofs)
* Anthropogenic heat from traffic (including traffic schedules)
* Vegetation coverage (both trees and shrubs)
* Atmospheric heat transfer from urban boundary and canopy layers

The [original Urban Weather Generator](http://urbanmicroclimate.scripts.mit.edu/uwg.php) was developed by Bruno Bueno for [his PhD thesis at MIT](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/59107).  Since this time, it has been validated 3 times and has been [enhanced by Aiko Nakano](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/108779).  In 2016, Joseph Yang also [improved the engine and added a range of building templates](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/107347).

This repository is a Python translation of the original [MATLAB Urban Weather Generator](https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab).

# Example
Here is a Python example that shows how to create and run an Urban Weather Generator object.

```python
from uwg import UWG

# Define the .epw, .uwg paths to create an uwg object.
epw_path = "resources/SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw" # available in resources directory.


# Initialize the UWG model by passing parameters as arguments, or relying on defaults
model = UWG.from_param_args(epw_path=epw_path, bldheight=10, blddensity=0.5,
                            vertohor=0.8, grasscover=0.1, treecover=0.1, zone='1A')

# Uncomment these lines to initialize the UWG model using a .uwg parameter file
# param_path = "initialize_singapore.uwg"  # available in resources directory.
# model = UWG.from_param_file(param_path, epw_path=epw_path)

model.generate()
model.simulate()

# Write the simulation result to a file.
model.write_epw()
```
